# ReddApp

A work-in-progress Android app for browsing Reddit

## Why build a Reddit app?

This project was born out of a desire to improve my software architecture and Android development skills by building a fairly large, complex app. As a regular user of Reddit, I figured an app for browsing the site would be useful and present an interesting development challenge.

I'm focusing on following best practices when architecting this app, including the use of the MVVM design pattern and dependency injection. I'm also trying to make use of the latest architecture tools provided by Google, such as the [Paging library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/) for loading pages of data, [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), and [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata).
